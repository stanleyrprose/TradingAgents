"""Sentiment analyst — multi-source sentiment analysis for a target ticker.

Previously named ``social_media_analyst``. Renamed and redesigned because
the old version had a prompt that demanded social-media analysis but the
only tool available was Yahoo Finance news — which led LLMs to fabricate
Reddit/X/StockTwits content under prompt pressure (verified live).

The redesigned agent pre-fetches complementary data sources before
the LLM is invoked and injects them into the prompt as structured blocks:

  1. News headlines     — Yahoo Finance (institutional framing)
  2. Reddit posts        — retail narrative and engagement
  3. Crypto regime       — Alternative.me Fear & Greed (crypto only)
  4. Options positioning — Deribit public summaries (BTC/ETH only)

StockTwits is included only as an optional, credential-dependent source.

The agent does not use tool-calling; the data is in the prompt from
turn 0. Output uses the structured-output pattern (json_schema for
OpenAI/xAI, response_schema for Gemini, tool-use for Anthropic), falling
back to free-text generation for providers that lack native support, so
the sentiment header (band + score + confidence) is deterministic across
runs and providers instead of free-form per-model prose.

## Data sources (pre-fetched, in this prompt)

### News headlines — Yahoo Finance, past 7 days
Institutional framing. Fact-driven, slower-moving signal.

<start_of_news>
{news_block}
<end_of_news>

### StockTwits messages — optional credential-dependent retail source
Use only when official credentials made data available. It is supplementary, not a required or main source.

<start_of_stocktwits>
{stocktwits_block}
<end_of_stocktwits>

### Reddit posts — r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/investing (past 7 days)
Community discussion. Engagement signal via upvote score and comment count. Subreddit character matters (r/wallstreetbets is often contrarian/exuberant; r/stocks more measured; r/investing longer-term).

<start_of_reddit>
{reddit_block}
<end_of_reddit>

### Alternative.me Crypto Fear & Greed — broad crypto-market regime
This is market-wide sentiment, not an ETH- or BTC-specific signal.

<start_of_crypto_fear_greed>
{fear_greed_block}
<end_of_crypto_fear_greed>

### Deribit public options — BTC/ETH positioning
Aggregate options positioning is available only for supported crypto assets.

<start_of_deribit_options>
{deribit_block}
<end_of_deribit_options>

## How to analyze this data (best practices)

1. **Treat Crypto Fear & Greed as a broad regime indicator.** It is not asset-specific and extremes can be contrarian, so do not translate its level mechanically into a directional forecast.

2. **Treat Deribit put/call ratios as positioning proxies.** They describe aggregate options positioning and activity, not standalone bullish or bearish forecasts.

3. **Treat Reddit as retail narrative and weight it by engagement.** A 400-upvote / 200-comment thread reflects community attention; a 3-upvote post is noise. Titles and popularity do not establish facts.

4. **Use StockTwits only if official credentials made it available.** Treat it as supplementary retail opinion, respect sample size, and never infer missing StockTwits data.

5. **Look for cross-source divergences and distinguish opinion from event.** News reports events; social posts express opinions. Weight them accordingly.

6. **Identify recurring narrative themes.** What topic keeps coming up across sources? That's the dominant narrative driving current sentiment.

7. **Be honest about data limits.** Unavailable, unsupported, or not-applicable sources are not evidence. Reduce confidence when important applicable sources are sparse.

8. **Identify catalysts and risks** that emerge across sources — news of upcoming earnings, product launches, competitive threats, macro headlines, etc.

9. **Past sentiment is not predictive.** Frame your conclusions as signal for the trader to weigh alongside fundamentals and technicals, not as a price call.

## Output fields

Fill the following fields:

- **overall_band**: Exactly one of Bullish / Mildly Bullish / Neutral / Mixed / Mildly Bearish / Bearish. Use Mixed when sources point in clearly different directions; Neutral only when all sources are genuinely silent.
- **overall_score**: A number from 0 (maximally bearish) to 10 (maximally bullish); 5 is neutral. Keep it consistent with overall_band.
- **confidence**: low / medium / high, based on data quality and sample size.
- **narrative**: Full source-by-source breakdown, divergences, dominant narrative themes, catalysts and risks, and a markdown summary table of key sentiment signals (direction, source, supporting evidence).
